    "- the dataframe with all the links to scrape is called df_stateName\n",
    "- the dataframe with all the scraped information is called df_all_stateName\n",

    "The distilled information should at least contain the name, number of victims, date of offense, date of execution, race, gender, state, and final words. The dataframes contain a bunch of garbage columns that are not needed, and that will be taken care of in another notebook: in the end we'll only want 8 columns for each state df, and we'll concatenate all of them to have an overall df of all executions in the US since 1976. \n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: when the information we are interested in was missing (noted 'NOT FOUND' in the scraped df), it was retrieved by hand - by reading the multiple press releases, and articles included on the convict's webpage on murderopedia, when it came to dates and last words. For race and gender, deathpenalty.org execution database was used. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: final_words are usually spoke, except when precised otherwise. A few written statements are in there, but they are formatted as letters, so the difference between written / spoken statements should be rather straightforward to readers. \n",

    "We'll be able to use this overall df in d3 - and we'll also create multiple smaller dfs for each year we have data for, and each gender, for the purposes of a search bar (I know there's a way to optimize this but for now oh well.) \n"
