This is what happens to black men when they stand up and protest for what is right and just. We refuse to compromise, we refuse to surrender the dignity for what we know is right. But we will move on, we have been strong in the past. We will continue to be strong as a people. You can kill a revolutionary, but you cannot stop the revolution. The revolution will go on. The people will carry the revolution on. You are the people that must carry that revolutionary on, in order to liberate our children from this genocide and for what is happening here in America tonight. What has happened for the last 100 or so years in America. This is the part of the genocide, this is part of the African (unintelligible), that we as black people have endured in America. But we shall overcome, we will continue with this. We will continue, we will gain our freedom and liberation, by any means necessary. Stay strong. They cannot kill us. We will move forward. To my sons, to my daughters, all of you. I love all of you. You have been wonderful. Keep your heads up. Keep moving forward. Keep united. Maintain the love and unity in the community.

We're gonna stop, we are going to end the death penalty in this country. We are going to end it all across this world. Push forward people. And know that what ya'll are doing is right. What ya'll are doing is just. This is nothing more that pure and simple murder. This is what is happening tonight in America. Nothing more than state sanctioned murders, state sanctioned lynching, right here in America, and right here tonight. This is what is happening my brothers. Nothing less. They know I'm innocent. They've got the facts to prove it. They know I'm innocent. But they cannot acknowledge my innocence, because to do so would be to publicly admit their guilt. This is something these racist people will never do. We must remember brothers, this is what we're faced with. You must take this endeavor forward. You must stay strong. You must continue to hold your heads up, and to be there. And I love you, too, my brother. All of you who are standing with me in solidarity. We will prevail. We will keep marching.

They are murdering me tonight.""'","""I would like to say that I did not kill Bobby Lambert. That I'm an innocent black man that is being murdered. This is a lynching that is happening in America tonight. There's overwhelming and compelling evidence of my defense that has never been heard in any court of America. What is happening here is an outrage for any civilized country to anybody anywhere to look at what's happening here is wrong. I thank all of the people that have rallied to my cause. They've been standing in support of me. Who have finished with me. I say to Mr. Lambert's family, I did not kill Bobby Lambert. You are pursuing the execution of an innocent man. I want to express my sincere thanks to all of ya'll. We must continue to move forward and do everything we can to outlaw legal lynching in America. We must continue to stay strong all around the world, and people must come together to stop the systematic killing of poor and innocent black people. We must continue to stand together in unity and to demand a moratorium on all executions. We must not let this murder/lynching be forgotten tonight, my brothers. We must take it to the nation. We must keep our faith. We must go forward. We recognize that many leaders have died. Malcom X, Martin Luther King, and others who stood up for what was right. They stood up for what was just. We must, you must brothers, that's why I have called you today. You must carry on that condition. What is here is just a lynching that is taking place. But they're going to keep on lynching us for the next 100 years, if you do not carry on that tradition, and that period of resistance. We will prevail. We may loose this battle, but we will win the war. This death, this lynching will be avenged. It will be avenged, it must be avenged. The people must avenge this murder. So my brothers, all of ya'll stay strong, continue to move forward. Know that I love all of you. I love the people, I love all of you for your blessing, strength, for your courage, for your dignity, the way you have come here tonight, and the way you have protested and kept this nation together. Keep moving forward, my brothers. Slavery couldn't stop us. The lynching couldn't stop us in the south. This lynching will not stop us tonight. We will go forward. Our destiny in this country is freedom and liberation. We will gain our freedom and liberation by any means necessary. By any means necessary, we keep marching forward. I love you, Mr. Jackson. Bianca, make sure that the state does not get my body. Make sure that we get my name as Shaka Sankofa. My name is not Gary Graham. Make sure that it is properly presented on my grave. Shaka Sankofa. I died fighting for what I believe in. I died fighting for what was just and what was right. I did not kill Bobby Lambert, and the truth is going to come out. It will be brought out. I want you to take this thing off into international court, Mr. Robert Mohammed and all ya'll. I want you, I want to get my family and take this down to international court and file a law suit. Get all the video tapes of all the beatings. They have beat me up in the back. They have beat me up at the unit over there. Get all the video tapes supporting that law suit. And make the public exposed to the genocide and this brutality world, and let the world see what is really happening here behind closed doors. Let the world see the barbarity and injustice of what is really happening here. You must get those video tapes. You must make it exposed, this injustice, to the world. You must continue to demand a moratorium on all executions. We must move forward Minister Robert Mohammed. Ashanti Chimurenga, I love you for standing with me, my sister.

I want to remind Mr. Price of the mistake he made at Gene Hawthorn's trial when he said that Gene Hawthorn was telling the truth at my trial. Mr. Price is a one-eyed hunting dog. He in fact is not a one-eyed hunting dog, and in fact Gene Hawthorn lied at my trial. Everybody knew it. I'm dying tonight based on testimony, that all parties, me, the man who gave the testimony, the prosecutor he used knew it was a lie. I am hoping somebody will call him to the floor for recent comments he's made in the newspaper. It's bad enough that a prosecutor can take truth and spin on it and try to re-doctor it. But when they actually make facts up and present to the public as trial's evidence. That goes beyond fail, that's completely unforgivable and I hope somebody makes Mr. Price account for or explain the tennis shoes he is talking about that put me here. I'm still completely lost on that and I'm hoping that somebody will go back and verify the trial record and make him accountable for lying to the public and the press that way. That's really all I have to say except that I love my family. and nobody, nobody has got a better family than me. I love you booger bear. I love doodle bug, too. Don't let them ever forget me. I'll never forget them. I'll see you on the other side, okay. Bye bye Debbie. Bye bro, bye booger bear. Father Mike, Father Walsh, love you all. That's all, sir.""", i want to start out by acknowledging the love that i ve had in my family  no man in this world has had a better family than me  i had the best parents in the world  i had the best brothers and sisters in the world  i ve had the most wonderful life any man could have ever had  i ve never been more proud of anybody than i have of my daughter and my son  i ve got no complaints and no regrets about that  i love everyone of them and have always been loved all of my life  i ve never had any doubts about that  couple of matters that i want to talk about since this is one of the few times people will listen to what i have to say  the unites states has gotten to a now where they zero respect for human life  my death is just a symptom of a bigger illness  at some point the government has got to wake up and stop doing things to destroy other countries and killing innocent children  the ongoing embargo and sanctions against places like iran and irag  cuba and other places  they are not doing anything to change the world  but they are harming innocent children  that s got to stop at some point  perhaps more important in a lot of ways is what we are doing to the environment is even more devastating because as long as we keep going the direction we re going the end result is it won t matter how we treat other people because everybody on the planet will be on their way out  we have got to wake up and stop doing that  ah  one of the few ways in the world the truth is ever going to get out  or people are ever going to know what s happening as long as we support a free press out there  i see the press struggling to stay existent as a free institution one of the few truly free institutions is the press in texas  people like the texas observer and i want to thank them for the job they ve done in keeping me and everybody else informed  i hope people out there will support them  listen to them and be there for them  without it  things like this are going to happen and nobody will even know  i love all of you  i always have i always will  i would like to address the state of texas and specially joe price  the district attorney who put me here  i want to remind mr  price of the mistake he made at gene hawthorn s trial when he said that gene hawthorn was telling the truth at my trial  mr  price is a one eyed hunting dog  he in fact is not a one eyed hunting dog  and in fact gene hawthorn lied at my trial  everybody knew it  i m dying tonight based on testimony  that all parties  me  the man who gave the testimony  the prosecutor he used knew it was a lie  i am hoping somebody will call him to the floor for recent comments he s made in the newspaper  it s bad enough that a prosecutor can take truth and spin on it and try to re doctor it  but when they actually make facts up and present to the public as trial s evidence  that goes beyond fail  that s completely unforgivable and i hope somebody makes mr  price account for or explain the tennis shoes he is talking about that put me here  i m still completely lost on that and i m hoping that somebody will go back and verify the trial record and make him accountable for lying to the public and the press that way  that s really all i have to say except that i love my family  and nobody  nobody has got a better family than me  i love you booger bear  i love doodle bug  too  don t let them ever forget me  i ll never forget them  i ll see you on the other side  okay  bye bye debbie  bye bro  bye booger bear  father mike  father walsh  love you all  that s all  sir  ,True,True,True,False,False,False
