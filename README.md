# Deathrows

This repository contains the analysis of all the executed inmates' last words since the death penalty was reintroduced in the US.

- The folder `states_csv` contains 1 CSV per state. Each CSV contains information about each inmate who has been executed by the state.
- The folder `thematic_csv` contains the same information but grouped by gender and race. 
- The folder `notebooks` contains 2 Jupyter notebooks: the one I used to retrieve all the information through web-scraping, and another one in which I analyzed the data, and ran a text analysis on it.
- The folder `interactive has the HTML/CSS/JavaScript code
